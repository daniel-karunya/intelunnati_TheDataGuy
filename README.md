Problem Statement: Design and Implementation of slow and fast division algorithms in Computer Architecture

SLOW DIVISION:-
>-Method Used: Restoring Division
>
>-Main file and test bench files can be excecuted as required


FAST DIVISION:-
>-Method Used: Lookup Table with Combinational Multiplier
>
>-Main file Lookup_Table_Fast_Dividion.v has a dependency on mult.v program it calls mult.v(the combinational multiplier)

FILES PRESENT: -
>-code contains folder with all the verilog codes for bothSlow and Fast Division
>
>-demo_video folder contains folders with the unlisted youtube video links for the demo videos for both methods
>
>-docs folder contains the full project report as per the required format with detailed step by step excecution
>
>-output_screenshots folder contains step by step outputs for each on the division methods
